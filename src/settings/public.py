"""Public settings.

This is a Python file containing your public game settings.  You can modify
these settings simply by changing their Python value.  If you want to
hide this setting from players (you don't want to show them your password
salt for instance), you can copy the setting from this file, paste it
in "settings/prifvate.py" and update it there.  This change won't appear
in your source tree.

# 2. Security settings
# Note: password settings that are changed AFTER the first accounts
#       have been created will render these accounts impossible to
#       connect to because their password can't be accessed anymore.  If
#       you change these settings, do it before your create your first
#       accounts, or change them and erase your database altogether
#       to start from fresh.
#       BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE to change these settings as they provide
#       a high degree of security already.

# Algorithm name to use to hash passwords.
# Recommended choices are sha256 and sha512, but you can use something else.

# Salt size
# The salt will be randomly-generated for each password.  It is
# recommended your salt to be at least 16 bytes in length, but it
# can be longer.

# Number of iterations
# To store your password, the algorithm will build a stronger hash
# if you specify a greater number of iteration.  The greater the number,
# the slower it will perform however.  It is recommended to use at least
# 100,000 iterations for a SHA-256 password, so that's the default setting.

# for you.  But you can override its decision.  Set to `None` to
# let PBKDF2 decide.

# 3. Network interfaces and ports

# Allow external connections (from the Internet). Note that even if this
# setting is set to True, accessing your game from the Internet will
